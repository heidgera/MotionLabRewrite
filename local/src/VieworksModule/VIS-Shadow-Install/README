 VIS-Shadow is a software package including SDK and viewer designed for use with 
Vieworks Gigabit Ethernet (GigE) cameras on Linux-based systems.


2. System Requirements
 The recommended GigE network adapters for use with Vieworks GigE cameras are Intel 
PCI-Express network interface cards (PT or CT series). If your motherboard supports 
only standard PCI slots, it is recommended to use general Intel PCI NIC (GT, MT or 
PRO/1000 series).

system.
